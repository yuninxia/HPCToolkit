/// happens we can still record data on A, thus we have:
///     ... -> A -> F - ...*something*... -> B
/// The purpose of a ContextReconstruction is to fill in that "something" using
/// static binary analysis, in short the static control flow (or call) graph.
/// A shared ContextFlowGraph is referenced to store the bits needed.
///
/// The complication is that there might be multiple paths through the Graph
/// which are a valid "something." The measurements aren't able to distinguish
/// between them, so instead we "redistribute" the metric values attributed to
/// the Reconstruction among the possibilities. Something like:
///     ... -> A -> F - X -> B  += 0.556 * metric values
///     ... -> A -> F - Y -> B  += 0.377 * metric values
///     ... -> A -> G - Z -> B  += 0.067 * metric values
/// Since `... -> A` is a prefix to this Context sub-tree, it is called the
/// "root" of the Reconstruction. The generation of these factors is complex and
/// given in more detail in ContextFlowGraph::Template, but in this case they
/// are generated entirely only from the metric values of the "entry point(s)"
/// `... -> A -> (F|G)` and of sibling Reconstructions for X, Y and Z.
///

///     ... -> A -> (unknown) -> B
/// where we don't know F or aren't confident enough to fill in the "something"
