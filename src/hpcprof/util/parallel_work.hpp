/// Core implementation mixin behind all the ParallelFor worksharing classes.

/// This class implements a simple worksharing construct, where worker threads
/// are able to (attempt to) contribute() and perform work that a master thread
/// has supplied with rawFill(). "Work" here is simply unsigned integer indices,
/// derived classes may provide a cleaner interface, see ParallelForEach.
///
/// Conceptually, a ParallelFor object can be in one of three states:
///   - The "initial" state, before rawFill() has provided work to be performed,
///   - The "working" state, when work is actively being processed by worker
///     threads via contribute(), and
///   - The "completed" state, after all work has been processed and no new work
///     will be added.
/// To assist the description of parallel operations, we define the state as
/// "stable" from a thread's perspective if that thread has performed the
/// appropriate synchronization (waitForStable()) to ensure that no worker
/// threads are still performing work. Before waitForStable() is called, the
/// object (from a thread's perspective) may be in one of two pseudo-states:
///   - The "unstable initial" psuedo-state for the "initial" state, and
///   - The "unstable completed" pseudo-state for the "completed" state.
/// Note that the the "working" state is always considered "unstable."
///
/// The methods on this class transition the object as a whole between these
/// three states, while remaining thread-safe between workers and the master
/// thread(s). Derived classes are allowed to choose the transition behavior of
/// contribute() for their own needs, see the documentation there for details.
