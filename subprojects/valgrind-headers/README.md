This is a small redistribution of certain Valgrind headers with a short Meson wrapper. This makes it easy to use the Valgrind headers for annotations without a full Valgrind installation. These headers are distributed under a BSD-style license which permits their redistribution in other projects.

Full Valgrind sources are available for download here: https://valgrind.org/downloads/
