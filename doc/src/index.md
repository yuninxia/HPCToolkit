# Welcome to HPCToolkit's documentation!

HPCToolkit is an integrated suite of tools for measurement and analysis of program performance on computers ranging from multicore desktop systems to the world’s largest supercomputers.
HPCToolkit provides accurate measurements of a program’s work, resource consumption, and inefficiency, correlates these metrics with the program’s source code, works with multilingual, fully optimized binaries, has low measurement overhead, and scales to large parallel systems.
HPCToolkit’s measurements provide support for analyzing a program execution cost, inefficiency, and scaling characteristics both within and across nodes of a parallel system.
